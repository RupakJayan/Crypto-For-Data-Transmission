# Crypto-For-Data-Transmission
This repository implements an enhanced ChaCha20 encryption algorithm that integrates Ikeda map-based chaotic perturbation to introduce additional randomness into the encryption process. By combining lightweight cryptography with chaotic systems, this approach enhances security while maintaining high-speed encryption.
